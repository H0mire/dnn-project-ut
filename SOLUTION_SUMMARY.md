# Ultrasound Organ Classification - Solution Summary

## Problem Statement
Classify ultrasound images of bladder and kidney with only 50 training images per class, without using pretrained models.

## Solution Overview

### 1. Feature Extraction Strategy

Given the limited data constraint, I implemented a **dual feature extraction approach**:

#### A. Handcrafted Features (88 features total)
- **Texture Features (60 features)**: Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) properties
  - Contrast, dissimilarity, homogeneity, energy, correlation
  - Multiple distances (1, 3, 5 pixels) and angles (0°, 45°, 90°, 135°)
- **Intensity Features (23 features)**: Statistical measures
  - Mean, std, median, percentiles (25th, 75th), min, max
  - 16-bin histogram features
- **Shape Features (5 features)**: Region-based properties
  - Area statistics, eccentricity, solidity, extent

#### B. Deep Learning Features
- **Shallow CNN Architecture**: Custom 3-layer CNN designed for small datasets
  - Conv Block 1: 16 filters (5×5) → BatchNorm → ReLU → MaxPool
  - Conv Block 2: 32 filters (3×3) → BatchNorm → ReLU → MaxPool  
  - Conv Block 3: 64 filters (3×3) → BatchNorm → ReLU → AdaptiveAvgPool
  - Classifier: Dropout(0.5) → FC(1024→128) → ReLU → Dropout(0.5) → FC(128→2)

### 2. Data Augmentation
To address the limited dataset size:
- Random rotation (±10 degrees)
- Random horizontal flipping
- Random affine transformations (translation ±10%)
- Color jittering (brightness and contrast ±20%)

### 3. Training Strategy
- **Data Split**: 80% train, 20% validation from training set
- **Batch Size**: 8 (suitable for small dataset)
- **Optimizer**: Adam with weight decay (1e-4) for regularization
- **Learning Rate**: 0.001 with ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler
- **Epochs**: 100 with early stopping potential

### 4. Model Architecture Details

#### Shallow CNN (Primary Model)
```
Input: 128×128×3 RGB images
├── Conv2d(3→16, 5×5) + BatchNorm + ReLU + MaxPool(2×2)
├── Conv2d(16→32, 3×3) + BatchNorm + ReLU + MaxPool(2×2)
├── Conv2d(32→64, 3×3) + BatchNorm + ReLU + AdaptiveAvgPool(4×4)
├── Flatten → 1024 features
├── Dropout(0.5) + Linear(1024→128) + ReLU
└── Dropout(0.5) + Linear(128→2) → Output
```

#### Hybrid Classifier (Advanced)
- Combines CNN features (1024) + Handcrafted features (88)
- Uses ensemble methods (Random Forest + SVM)
- Feature scaling with StandardScaler

## Results

### Primary CNN Model
- **Test Accuracy**: 95% (19/20 correct predictions)
- **Precision**: Bladder 1.00, Kidney 0.91
- **Recall**: Bladder 0.90, Kidney 1.00
- **F1-Score**: Both classes 0.95

### Feature Analysis
- **CNN Features Only**: 100% cross-validation accuracy
- **Handcrafted Features Only**: 98.75% cross-validation accuracy  
- **Combined Features**: 100% cross-validation accuracy

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Why Shallow CNN?
- **Small Dataset**: Deep networks prone to overfitting with 50 images/class
- **Regularization**: BatchNorm + Dropout prevent overfitting
- **Adaptive Pooling**: Handles varying input sizes gracefully

### 2. Why Handcrafted Features?
- **Domain Knowledge**: Medical imaging benefits from traditional features
- **Complementary Information**: Texture/shape features complement CNN features
- **Robustness**: Less prone to overfitting than deep features

### 3. Why Data Augmentation?
- **Effective Dataset Size**: Increases from 100 to ~1000+ effective samples
- **Medical Relevance**: Rotations/flips are realistic variations
- **Generalization**: Improves model robustness
