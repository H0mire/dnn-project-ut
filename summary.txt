Ultrasound Image Classification - Summary Report
=================================================

Project Description:
--------------------
This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) based classifier 
for ultrasound images to distinguish between six different organ classes: 
bladder, bowel, gallbladder, kidney, liver, and spleen.

Model:
------
- Architecture: MiniVGGNet
- Structure:
  - Two convolutional blocks with 2 Conv layers each
  - Batch Normalization and ReLU activations
  - MaxPooling layers
  - Adaptive Average Pooling
  - Fully connected classifier with Dropout regularization

Dataset:
--------
- Training set: 50 images per class
- Test set: 10 images per class
- Total classes: 6

Training Details:
-----------------
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss Function: CrossEntropyLoss
- Batch size: 8
- Epochs: 30
- Data Augmentation: Random flips, rotations, etc.

Performance:
------------
- Training Accuracy: ~97%
- Best Validation Accuracy: 100%
- Test Accuracy: 93.3%
- Macro Average F1-Score: 0.93

Confusion Matrix:
-----------------
The model performed well across all classes with minimal confusion, 
achieving perfect classification in multiple classes.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates that a small custom CNN like MiniVGGNet can achieve excellent 
classification performance on a small medical imaging dataset.No pretrained models were used, 
making the system lightweight and suitable for deployment or extension to larger datasets 
in the future.
