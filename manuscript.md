# A Shallow Convolutional Neural Network Architecture for Ultrasound Organ Classification with Limited Training Data

## Abstract

**Background**: Medical ultrasound image classification faces significant challenges when dealing with limited training datasets, particularly in scenarios where pretrained models are not available. This study addresses the classification of bladder and kidney ultrasound images using only 50 training samples per class.

**Methods**: We developed a shallow convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture specifically designed for small medical datasets. The model incorporates strategic regularization techniques, data augmentation, and a hybrid feature extraction approach combining learned CNN features with handcrafted image processing features.

**Results**: The proposed shallow CNN achieved 95% accuracy on the test dataset, significantly outperforming a more complex hybrid ensemble approach (75% accuracy). The model demonstrated excellent precision and recall metrics: bladder classification (precision=1.00, recall=0.90) and kidney classification (precision=0.91, recall=1.00).

**Conclusions**: For ultrasound organ classification with severely limited data, shallow CNN architectures with appropriate regularization outperform complex ensemble methods. The key to success lies in matching model complexity to dataset size rather than maximizing feature diversity.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background and Motivation

Medical ultrasound imaging serves as a primary diagnostic tool in clinical practice due to its non-invasive nature, real-time capability, and cost-effectiveness. However, accurate interpretation of ultrasound images requires significant expertise and experience. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have emerged as valuable tools to assist clinicians in image interpretation and reduce diagnostic variability.

The classification of organ types in ultrasound images presents unique challenges compared to other medical imaging modalities. Ultrasound images exhibit characteristic properties including speckle noise, acoustic shadows, and variable image quality dependent on operator skill and patient anatomy. These factors contribute to the complexity of developing robust automated classification systems.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

This study addresses the specific challenge of binary classification between bladder and kidney ultrasound images under severe data constraints:
- Limited training data: 50 images per organ class
- No access to pretrained models
- Requirement for high classification accuracy suitable for medical applications
- Need for computational efficiency suitable for clinical deployment

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Dataset Description

The dataset comprises ultrasound images from two organ classes:
- **Training Set**: 50 bladder images, 50 kidney images
- **Test Set**: 10 bladder images, 10 kidney images
- **Image Format**: PNG format, variable dimensions
- **Preprocessing**: Resized to 128×128 pixels, normalized to [0,1] range

### 3.2 Shallow CNN Architecture

#### 3.2.1 Design Principles

The proposed architecture follows several key design principles:

1. **Shallow Depth**: Limited to three convolutional layers to prevent overfitting
2. **Progressive Feature Learning**: Gradual increase in filter complexity
3. **Heavy Regularization**: Multiple regularization mechanisms at each layer
4. **Adaptive Pooling**: Flexible handling of input dimensions

#### 3.2.2 Network Architecture

The complete network architecture is detailed below:

```
Input Layer: 128×128×3 RGB images

Convolutional Block 1:
├── Conv2D(filters=16, kernel_size=5×5, padding='same')
├── BatchNormalization()
├── ReLU activation
└── MaxPooling2D(pool_size=2×2, stride=2)
Output: 64×64×16

Convolutional Block 2:
├── Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=3×3, padding='same')
├── BatchNormalization()
├── ReLU activation
└── MaxPooling2D(pool_size=2×2, stride=2)
Output: 32×32×32

Convolutional Block 3:
├── Conv2D(filters=64, kernel_size=3×3, padding='same')
├── BatchNormalization()
├── ReLU activation
└── AdaptiveAvgPool2D(output_size=4×4)
Output: 4×4×64

Feature Vector: Flatten() → 1024 features

Classification Head:
├── Dropout(p=0.5)
├── Linear(1024 → 128)
├── ReLU activation
├── Dropout(p=0.5)
└── Linear(128 → 2)
```

#### 3.2.3 Architectural Rationale

**Filter Sizes**: The initial 5×5 filters capture larger structural patterns typical in ultrasound images, while subsequent 3×3 filters refine local features.

**Channel Progression**: The gradual increase from 16→32→64 filters provides sufficient feature diversity without excessive parameters.

**Batch Normalization**: Applied after each convolution to stabilize training and enable higher learning rates.

**Adaptive Pooling**: Ensures consistent feature map dimensions regardless of input variations.

**Dropout Regularization**: High dropout rates (0.5) in the classifier prevent overfitting to the small training set.

### 3.3 Data Augmentation Strategy

├── RandomAffine(translate=±10%)
└── ColorJitter(brightness=±20%, contrast=±20%)
```

#### 3.3.2 Medical Relevance

Each augmentation technique reflects realistic clinical variations:
- **Rotation**: Accounts for probe orientation variations
